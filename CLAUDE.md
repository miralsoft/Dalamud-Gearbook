  Keep the three lines above. A committed copy of a template ages silently and nothing about
  it says how old it is, so M-19 requires it to carry the version it came from. It is what the
  release-time review of the declared foundation version (M-17) compares against.

You are working on `Gearbook`, a Dalamud plugin for Final Fantasy XIV that lets a player find,
filter and switch gearsets without spending hotbar slots. This file is a signpost, not a
rulebook. The rules are not in this repository; they are in the MIRAL Soft foundation, and they
are read from there rather than copied here.

## The foundation

This project is **external** in the sense of M-12: its documentation lives here in `docs/`, and
nothing is ever written back to the foundation. The foundation is read-only for this repository.

Clone it once, next to nothing else, and pull it at the start of every working session:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MIRAL-Soft/miralsoft-foundation-docs.git .foundation-docs
cd .foundation-docs && git pull
```

Keep the clone out of this repository through the clone's own exclude file, not through
`.gitignore`:

```sh
echo '.foundation-docs/' >> .git/info/exclude
```

`.git/info/exclude` rather than `.gitignore` on purpose: the exclude file is never committed, so
the arrangement stays a local convenience and does not become a line in a repository that has
nothing to do with it.

## Read in this order, before doing anything

From `.foundation-docs/`:

1. `rules/_meta.md`, the constitution.
2. Every file in `rules/`. They are short.
3. The profiles this project declares in `docs/project.md`: `rules/languages/csharp.md` and
   `rules/frameworks/dalamud.md`. The framework profile carries the constraints that can
   actually break the product, so it is not the optional one.
4. `blueprints/dalamud-plugin.md`. It is binding (M-14) and says how a plugin of this kind is
   built. Every entry in it is marked load-bearing, meaning there is a stated reason it has to
   be that way, or convention, meaning any consistent choice would work and this one was chosen
   so that plugins look alike. Departing from either is recorded in `docs/decisions.md`;
   departing from a load-bearing entry answers the reason it states.

Then from this repository, in `docs/`:

5. The project memory first: `status.md`, `decisions.md`, `todos.md`, `open-points.md`. This is
   how the previous session hands over, and it is the only handover there is (M-08, I-07).
6. `project.md`, `architecture.md`, `rules-project.md`.

## Enforcement

Install the hooks from the foundation into this clone. They are not part of any repository, so a
fresh clone needs them again:

```sh
cp .foundation-docs/enforcement/hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg
cp .foundation-docs/enforcement/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

`.miralsoft-enforcement` at this repository's root configures them: the committer identity this
project uses (R-03, R-19) and the file patterns checked for em-dashes (I-02). Every check the
hooks perform also runs in CI (R-17), because a hook lives in a clone and gets forgotten.

If a hook blocks a commit, fix the cause. Do not bypass it (R-08).

## While working

- Global rules are binding and read-only. This project may tighten them in `docs/rules-project.md`,
  never weaken or contradict them (M-01, M-04).
- This project is bound by the foundation version it declares in `docs/project.md` (M-17). A rule
  added to the foundation later does not bind it until that declaration is raised. Review the
  declaration whenever a release is cut: read the foundation changelog from the declared version
  onward, then either raise it and do the work, or leave it and record why.
- An agent changes exactly one repository, this one (M-18). Reading another is allowed and often
  required. A consequence for `Dalamud-Eorzea-Arsenal` or for the plugin index repository is
  written into `docs/open-points.md`, marked as belonging there, and it stops at that.
- Update `docs/status.md` at the end of every working session, and append to `docs/decisions.md`
  when something is decided, including the paths that were rejected and why (M-08, M-15).
- An AI is never named as author or co-author, anywhere (R-09, I-06).

No rules are duplicated here. Follow the documents above.
